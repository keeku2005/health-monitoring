“I built a Remote Health Monitoring System using IoT, Cloud, and Web technologies.
On the hardware side, I used an ESP8266 microcontroller with a pulse sensor and a DS18B20 temperature sensor. The ESP8266 reads real-time health data and sends it securely to a backend API via HTTPS.
I developed the backend using Node.js and MongoDB Atlas, where all sensor readings are stored in a cloud database.
For the front-end, I built a React dashboard that fetches the data and displays live graphs and readings.
This system helps in monitoring elderly patients remotely and can be extended with alerts and more sensors.”
